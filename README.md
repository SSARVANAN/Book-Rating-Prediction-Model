# Book-Rating-Prediction-Model
### Project Description
This project aims  to build a machine learning model capable of predicting a book’s rating by analyzing various features associated with books, such as title, author, number of pages, publication year, review counts etc.

### Installation
To set up the project, open the virtual environment and install the requirement file 
You can install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data
Check the data folder 
### The Jupyter notebook contains the following key sections:(There are Three approaches)
### Methodology
  1.Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning the data.
  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing user and book rating distributions.
  3.Model Training: Training machine learning models using regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression,   Decision Tree-AdaBoost Regression, Random Forest Regression, ExtraTrees Regression, Gradient Boosting      Regression, MLPregressor) and classification models (Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
  4.Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like R2-score,MSE RMSE for regression and F1-score and accuracy for classification.

Tips for Writing a Good README:
Be concise but informative.
Use bullet points and sections to organize content.
Include examples where possible (e.g., sample inputs and outputs).
Use graphs and visuals (where applicable) to enhance understanding.
This structure helps users quickly understand your project, set it up, and run it successfully.
